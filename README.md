# Oil & Gas Tank Level Forecasting Solution - A Cortana Intelligence Solution How-to Guide

Today, most facilities operate reactively to problems in tank levels. This often leads to spills, emergency shutdowns, expensive remediation costs, regulatory issues, costly repairs and fines. Tank level forecasting allows facilities to manage and abate these and other problems.

Forecasts are created by harnessing the power of real-time and historical data from sensors, meters and records that is readily available.

- Prevent tank spillage and emergency shutdowns
- Discover hardware malfunction or failure
- Schedule maintenance, shutdowns, and logistics
- Optimize operations and facility efficiency
- Detect pipeline leaks and slugging
- Reduce costs, fines, and downtime

The tank level forecasting process starts at the well input. Oil is measured as it comes into the facility via meters and is sent to tanks. Levels are monitored and recorded in tanks during the refining process and then oil, gas, and water output are recorded via sensors, meters, and records. Forecasts are then made using data from the facility, forecasts can be made every 15 minutes for example.

The Cortana Intelligence Suite is adaptable and can be customized to meet different requirements that facilities and corporations have.
